## 0.2.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 0f47d6e: Replace the `.html` slug-suffix convention for bare-HTML rendering with a data-driven `metadata.no_layout` toggle.

  `Post` gains a free-form `metadata` JSON column (DynamoDB `a.json()` + `PublicPost` customType + `PostMetadata` TS interface in `ampless`). The well-known key `no_layout: boolean` tells the runtime to serve the post as bare HTML (no theme chrome, no Next.js root layout). Other keys are passed through unchanged for plugin / app use.

  Behavioural changes:
  - **Middleware**: the `/(slug).html → /raw/(slug).html` rewrite is gone. Slugs ending in `.html` are now treated as ordinary post URLs. The slug-suffix shortcut never carried real semantics (middleware can't see post fields), so the data column is now the only source of truth.
  - **Theme post dispatcher**: peeks at `post.metadata.no_layout` before delegating. When true, redirects to `/raw/<slug>` so the raw route handler can emit the body directly (the browser URL settles on `/raw/<slug>`).
  - **Raw route handler**: also enforces `metadata.no_layout === true` and 404s otherwise. A direct `/raw/<slug>` request for a normal post no longer leaks the body without theme chrome.
  - **Admin post form**: adds a "no layout" checkbox that writes `metadata.no_layout`. The checkbox merges into existing metadata (plugin state etc. is preserved on save).

  Migration for posts published before this release: rename the slug (drop `.html`) and tick the new "no layout" checkbox in the admin. The old URL `/promo.html` will no longer auto-route to the raw handler — set the metadata flag and the post lives at `/raw/promo` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 1238898: `create-ampless --deploy --domain <X>` now rewrites the scaffolded
  `cms.config.ts` so the admin sites list reflects the deployed domain
  from the very first build, instead of carrying the local-dev defaults
  into production:
  - `site.url` is rewritten from `'http://localhost:3000'` to
    `'https://<fullDomain>'`.
  - A `sites: { default: { domains: ['<fullDomain>'] } }` block is
    injected so the domain shows up in the admin sites list.

  Both rewrites are idempotent and only fire when the scaffold
  placeholders are still in place, so `--mount` mode against a project
  where the user already customized `cms.config.ts` is a no-op.

  To support the seeded single-entry `sites:` block without breaking
  local development (where `localhost` is not a registered domain),
  `ampless.resolveSiteId` now treats a single declared site as a
  catch-all for any host — matching what `isMultiSite` already considered
  "single-site mode". Multi-site behavior (strict host → site lookup, 404
  on unknown host) is unchanged for configurations with 2+ sites.

  Also: `create-ampless` now writes a canonical `.gitignore` into every
  scaffolded project (`node_modules/`, `.next/`, `next-env.d.ts`,
  `.amplify/`, `amplify_outputs.json`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `.env*`,
  `.DS_Store`, editor dirs, log files). Previously the scaffold shipped
  no `.gitignore` at all, leaving fresh projects vulnerable to committing
  `node_modules` or leaking `amplify_outputs.json` (which contains live
  Cognito identity pool ids). The constant is now shared between scaffold
  and `--mount` so they can't drift; `MOUNT_DEFAULT_GITIGNORE` continues
  to re-export the same value for backward compatibility.

## 0.2.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- 9f6adad: Bump all direct dependencies to latest majors so the alpha track isn't carrying a major version behind. Notable bumps:
  - `typescript` 5.9 → 6.0
  - `next` 15 → 16 (Amplify adapter-nextjs peer allows up to <17)
  - `@tiptap/*` 2.27 → 3.23 — editor API migration (BubbleMenu moved to `@tiptap/react/menus`, `tippyOptions` → `options` for Floating-UI)
  - `vitest` 2 → 4
  - `eslint` 9 → 10
  - `lucide-react` 0.469 → 1.16
  - `tailwind-merge` 2 → 3
  - `@jsquash/avif` 1 → 2
  - `@clack/prompts` 0.9 → 1.4
  - plus all minor / patch refreshes (turbo, @aws-sdk, changesets, @types/node, typescript-eslint, vite)

  Behavioural code changes:
  - `theme-actions.ts`: `revalidateTag` → `updateTag` (Next 16's read-your-own-writes variant for Server Actions)
  - `image-bubble-menu.tsx`: tiptap 3 import path + Floating-UI option shape
  - TS 6 strict-mode fixes (catch params, side-effect css import declaration)

## 0.2.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial alpha release. Sets up the library architecture (runtime / admin / backend / plugins / cli / mcp-server) for upgrade-friendly install. Pre-1.0 — breaking changes possible in any minor version.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- v0.1.0 — initial public MVP release.
  - `create-ampless` CLI: scaffolds a Next.js 15 (App Router) blog with the
    Amplify Gen 2 backend definitions baked in.
  - `ampless` core library: shared types, plugin contract (`definePlugin`,
    hooks, `PluginRuntimeContext`), event types, and helpers (`escapeXml`,
    `formatPublicAssetUrl`, `formatDate`, `processImage`, `defineSchema`,
    `defineConfig`).
  - `@ampless/plugin-seo`: OGP / Twitter / canonical metadata for posts and
    the site, plus a `sitemap.xml` regenerated to S3 on every content event.
  - `@ampless/plugin-rss`: RSS 2.0 `/feed.xml` regenerated to S3 on every
    content event, with `<language>` tag and per-call options.
  - `@ampless/plugin-webhook`: POST event payloads to external URLs with
    optional HMAC-SHA-256 signing.
  - `@ampless/mcp-server`: stdio MCP server (Claude Desktop / Cursor /
    Claude Code) exposing 7 tools — list / get / create / update / delete
    posts, upload media, get schema. Authenticates as a Cognito user via
    SRP, so each tool runs with that user's role.
  - Trust-level event system: DynamoDB Streams → event-dispatcher Lambda →
    trusted / untrusted SQS queues → trust-level processor Lambdas. Plugin
    hooks fire in the matching trust level.
  - AppSync API key auto-renewal Lambda runs monthly (EventBridge Rule), so
    the public read path never silently 401s on key expiry.
